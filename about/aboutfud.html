	A Brief History
	</div>
	<div class="break"></div>
	<div class="info">
		The F&uuml;d website was made for an I.T. project at Camberwell Grammar School. The ITE 'Dijkstra' class has nineteen members, including the teacher, Mr. Fowler. This website was made for the young and inspired cooks looking for quality recipes with an easy layout. Using HTML5 and CSS3 as well as a major colaborative effort, this website has hit the internet with no advertising, giving an extremely enoyable experience on a quality website.
